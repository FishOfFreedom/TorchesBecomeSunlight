  "dialogue.frostnova_firstmeet.main1": "Miss, may I have a moment of your time?",
  "dialogue.frostnova_firstmeet.main2": "A stranger? Go on, let’s hear it.",
  "dialogue.frostnova_firstmeet.main3": "I’ve heard about the Snow Monster Squad's strength. Today, I’m here to join you.",
  "dialogue.frostnova_firstmeet.main4": "Join us? For what reason?",
  "dialogue.frostnova_firstmeet.main5": "I’ve suffered enough. This time, I want to shelter others.",
  "dialogue.frostnova_firstmeet.main6": "Alright, but guerrilla life is tough. Let me test your endurance first.",

  "dialogue.frostnova_fight.main1": "Before we fight, you’d better check your gear once again.",
  "dialogue.frostnova_fight.main1_o1": "Not yet, please give me a moment.",
  "dialogue.frostnova_fight.main1_o2": "I’m ready. Let’s start now.",
  "dialogue.frostnova_fight.main2": "Alright, that’s straightforward of you.",

  "dialogue.frostnova_win.main1": "Impressive. You’ve got the skills of those old-timers.",
  "dialogue.frostnova_win.main2": "Of course, this is for you.",
  "dialogue.frostnova_win.main3": "You’re too modest.",
  "dialogue.frostnova_win.main4": "Doesn’t Ursus say, ‘No fight, no friendship’?",
  "dialogue.frostnova_win.main5": "We’re all family now. No need to be so formal.",
  "dialogue.frostnova_win.main6": "Then can I call you FrostNova directly?",

  "dialogue.patriot_firstmeet.main1": "What is it?",
  "dialogue.patriot_firstmeet.main2": "Sir, you must be the 'Shield of the Infected'?",
  "dialogue.patriot_firstmeet.main3": "I wish to join your squad!",
  "dialogue.patriot_firstmeet.main4": "Join? For what reason?",
  "dialogue.patriot_firstmeet.main5": "I’ve suffered enough. Now, I want to shelter others.",
  "dialogue.patriot_firstmeet.main6": "I see... Seems like you’re a kind soul.",

  "dialogue.patriot_fight.main1": "The march is taxing, and the battles are tough. If you want the blood-and-steel life, you’ll need to pass my trial first.",
  "dialogue.patriot_fight.main1_o1": "I’m still not strong enough. Better not.",
  "dialogue.patriot_fight.main1_o2": "Of course. I am fairly confident in my strength.",
  "dialogue.patriot_fight.main2": "But remember, injuries are inevitable on the battlefield. I won’t go easy on you.",
  "dialogue.patriot_fight.main3": "Soldiers, disperse! We have a new recruit among us!",
  "dialogue.patriot_fight.main4": "As a rookie, I won’t go all out against you.",

  "dialogue.patriot_win.main1": "Very good. If only Ursus generals weren't so narrow-minded, you would be truly valued.",
  "dialogue.patriot_win.main2": "Conditions here are harsh and we haven't much, but take this for now.",
  "dialogue.patriot_win.main3": "Also, your agility is restricted here; you’d be more useful with Yelena.",

  "dialogue.find_rosmontis.main1": "Excuse me, sir? Is there something you need?",
  "dialogue.find_rosmontis.main1_o1": "Nothing in particular.",
  "dialogue.find_rosmontis.main1_o2": "I heard you’ve been helping the villagers. Thank you on their behalf.",
  "dialogue.find_rosmontis.main12": "Alright. Goodbye, sir.",
  "dialogue.find_rosmontis.main4": "Ah... Thank you. It’s just something small I can do.",
  "dialogue.find_rosmontis.main5": "And though I'm just a girl, helping out isn’t really tiring. Thank you for caring~",
  "dialogue.find_rosmontis.main5_o1": "Alright then, goodbye Miss Rosmontis.",
  "dialogue.find_rosmontis.main5_o2": "Oh? Not tired? Does your Originium Arts involve moving objects?",
  "dialogue.find_rosmontis.main6": "Are you curious? I can tell you.",
  "dialogue.find_rosmontis.main7": "My Originium Arts are of the psychokinesis type.",
  "dialogue.find_rosmontis.main8": "Though I struggle with control, moving heavy loads is easy for me.",
  "dialogue.find_rosmontis.main9": "Miss Rosmontis, please excuse me if I seem rude, but may I spar with you?",
  "dialogue.find_rosmontis.main10": "For today’s training, you’ll be my opponent. I’ll remember you.",
  "dialogue.find_rosmontis.main11": "Alright, follow me to the training room.",

  "dialogue.op_find_rosmontis.main1": "Welcome, is there something you need from the office?",
  "dialogue.op_find_rosmontis.main1_o1": "Oh, nothing really.",
  "dialogue.op_find_rosmontis.main1_o2": "Nothing much. I just saw a Rhodes Island member and wanted to thank you for helping the villagers.",
  "dialogue.op_find_rosmontis.main2": "Thank you, sir, but you should thank Miss Rosmontis most of all.",
  "dialogue.op_find_rosmontis.main3": "An Elite Operator? Can I meet her? I'd like to thank her in person.",
  "dialogue.op_find_rosmontis.main4": "Please wait, I’ll see if Miss Rosmontis is available.",
  "dialogue.op_find_rosmontis.main4_o1": "Something urgent came up; I have to go.",
  "dialogue.op_find_rosmontis.main4_o2": "Alright.",
  "dialogue.op_find_rosmontis.main7": "Miss Rosmontis is waiting for you in the office.",
  "dialogue.op_find_rosmontis.main6": "Miss Rosmontis is on a mission. Please come back another time.",

  "dialogue.rosmontis_fight.main11": "Sir, my Arts are not fully controlled, so I might go a bit hard. Please be careful not to get hurt.",
  "dialogue.rosmontis_fight.main1": "By the way, do you have any last preparations?",
  "dialogue.rosmontis_fight.main1_o1": "Please wait, I need to check my gear.",
  "dialogue.rosmontis_fight.main1_o2": "No, I’m all set. Let’s begin.",
  "dialogue.rosmontis_fight.main2": "For the first round, I’ll test your abilities. Feel free to attack; we won’t be hurt anyway.",

  "dialogue.rosmontis_win.main1": "Sir, you’re amazing! If I had complete control over my weapon, I’d still lose to you.",
  "dialogue.rosmontis_win.main3": "You are too modest, Miss Rosmontis. I just barely won since you were holding back.",
  "dialogue.rosmontis_win.main4": "No need to be polite, I’ll remember you.",
  "dialogue.rosmontis_win.main5": "Here, these are a reward for accompanying me in training.",

  "dialogue.gunknight_fight.main1": "Are you ready?",
  "dialogue.gunknight_fight.main1_o1": "Not yet, let me check my gear once more.",
  "dialogue.gunknight_fight.main1_o2": "Of course, I've been ready for a while.",
  "dialogue.gunknight_fight.main2": "Good, let the trial begin.",

  "dialogue.gunknight_fight_final.main1": "You handled melee combat well. You’re qualified.",
  "dialogue.gunknight_fight_final.main3": "As a guardian, the standards are naturally strict.",
  "dialogue.gunknight_fight_final.main4": "Are you ready to become a Sarkota now?",
  "dialogue.gunknight_fight_final.main4_o1": "No, I think I still need to train more.",
  "dialogue.gunknight_fight_final.main4_o2": "Yes, please bestow the halo upon me.",
  "dialogue.gunknight_fight_final.main2": "If so, prepare for the ceremony. The saint will crown you with the halo.",

  "dialogue.gunknight_finalfight.main1": "You can handle heavy gunfire well. That makes you a qualified 'traitor hunter.'",
  "dialogue.gunknight_finalfight.main3": "Here, take this.",
  "dialogue.gunknight_finalfight.main4": "Next, do you want to start the second test?",
  "dialogue.gunknight_finalfight.main4_o1": "There's a second test? I really wasn't expecting that.",
  "dialogue.gunknight_finalfight.main4_o2": "Of course. Bring on every challenge! I’m ready.",
  "dialogue.gunknight_finalfight.main2": "Great. Let's get started!",

  "dialogue.gunknight_firstmeet.main1": "Sir Gun Knight, is this where I take the trial?",
  "dialogue.gunknight_firstmeet.main1_o1": "I’m not ready yet, just asking.",
  "dialogue.gunknight_firstmeet.main1_o2": "Yes, what are the standards?",
  "dialogue.gunknight_firstmeet.main2": "In that case, you may need more training first. To avoid getting hurt, go defeat that nearby Pathfinder first.",

  "dialogue.gunknight_firstmeet1.main1": "Sir Gun Knight, is this where I take the trial?",
  "dialogue.gunknight_firstmeet1.main1_o1": "I’m not ready yet, just asking.",
  "dialogue.gunknight_firstmeet1.main1_o2": "Yes, what are the standards?",
  "dialogue.gunknight_firstmeet1.main2": "Good! You can start the trial right here.",
  "dialogue.gunknight_firstmeet1.main4": "So you’ve defeated the Last Land’s dragon already.",

  "dialogue.pathfinder_fight.main1": "Hello, can I help you?",
  "dialogue.pathfinder_fight.main1_o1": "Please wait, I need to arrange my equipment.",
  "dialogue.pathfinder_fight.main1_o2": "I’m ready. Please begin.",
  "dialogue.pathfinder_fight.main3": "Alright, let me test your strength.",
  "dialogue.pathfinder_fight.main4": "I’ve spoken to him; he sent me to challenge you.",

  "dialogue.pathfinder_findgun.main1": "Hello, can I help you?",
  "dialogue.pathfinder_findgun.main1_o1": "I have nothing to ask.",
  "dialogue.pathfinder_findgun.main1_o2": "What are the requirements to join the Holy City as a Sarkota Gun Knight?",
  "dialogue.pathfinder_findgun.main2": "Do you see the Gun Knight by the gate? Go speak with him.",
  "dialogue.pathfinder_findgun.main3": "Sir, I'm just the examiner.",

  "dialogue.pathfinder_firstmeet.main1": "Hello, can I help you?",
  "dialogue.pathfinder_firstmeet.main1_o1": "I have nothing to ask.",
  "dialogue.pathfinder_firstmeet.main1_o2": "What are the requirements to join the Holy City as a Sarkota Gun Knight?",
  "dialogue.pathfinder_firstmeet.main2": "Do you see the Gun Knight by the gate? Go speak with him.",

  "dialogue.pathfinder_win.main1": "Hello, can I help you?",
  "dialogue.pathfinder_win.main3_o1": "Please wait, I need to arrange my equipment.",
  "dialogue.pathfinder_win.main3_o2": "I’m ready. Please begin.",
  "dialogue.pathfinder_win.main3": "Alright, let me test your strength.",
  "dialogue.pathfinder_win.main4": "I’ve spoken to him; he sent me to challenge you.",
